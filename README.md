## DIVIDE-GAME


This is a simple but interesting game.

## Rules of the game

In this game, there is a 3x3 grid which is empty initially.
Below that there are 3 numbers in sequence. You can only drag the rightmost one.
If you place the number adjacent to any number in the grid, and if one is divisible by
the other. Then, the smaller among them vanishes and the larger one becomes the quotient.

For example, The two numbers are 6 and 12, Then 6 vanishes and 12 becomes 2.

The score gets updated as the game progresses. 

When the grid is filled, the game gets over.

Also, there is a blank box at the bottom where you can keep the box from the sequence for some time and drag it to the grid whenever you want.
